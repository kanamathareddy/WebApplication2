High Priority is given by the Management to address the complaints/grievances of the students and they are resolved at the earliest.
                                            Suggestions/Complaint Boxes are placed in prominent places for the students.
                                            The grievances of the students are a matter of top most priority for the college and the matter is resolved within the stipulated time.
                                            Grievances with regard to Ragging are redressed through Anti-Ragging Cell and those concerned to Girl students are handled by Women Grievance and Redressal Cell

                                            The function of the cell is to look into the complaints lodged by any student, and judge its merit. The Grievance cell is also empowered to look into matters of harassment. Anyone with a genuine grievance may approach the department members in person, or in consultation with the member of the Grievance Cell.
                                            In case the person is unwilling to appear in self, grievances may be dropped in writing at the letterbox/ suggestion box of the Grievance Cell at Administrative Block. Grievances may also be sent through e-mail to the Students’ Grievance Cell.

                                            WEC was established in our college on 9th July, 2013. Women Empowerment Cell (WEC) has been constituted for students to enhance the understanding of issues related to women, to develop, promote and disseminate knowledge about their role in society. It provides a platform to share their experiences and voices regarding their status in society and suggests ways to improve and empower themselves.

                                            The Constitution of India provides for “Gender Equality” and the “Right to life and liberty” to all persons under Articles 14, 19 and 21. It is thus the duty and mandate of every organization to provide maintenance of the fundamental rights to live and work with dignity for all employees: male and female.
                                            Due to the historical reasons, working women, often face difficulties and challenges at the work place, thereby necessitating the need for protective measures that safeguard women’s rights and safety.
                                            Women Empowerment Cell strives to maintain and augment the gender-neutral atmosphere of college. The Cell encourages the girls to come forward to talk about women related issues and tries to sensitize the youth about gender reality as the goal to emancipate and empower women. Focus of the Cell is to eliminate the discrimination and all forms of violence against women and girl child in Indian Society.

                                            The phrase “Research and Development” has a special significance apart from its conventional coupling of scientific research and technological development. “Research and Development” normally refers to future-oriented, longer-term activities in science or technology, using techniques with or without predetermined outcomes and with broad forecasts of commercial yields.
                                            Research is the backbone of academics. It simplifies concept building and transforms new ideas into innovations in pursuance of a new era of passion for researches. Each finding gives immense pleasure and multiplies enthusiasm towards achieving target.
                                            Research is a precursor to discovery and innovation.

                                            The Institution has a committee on anti-ragging since 2001. Considering the determination of the Central Government and the University Grants Commission to prohibit, prevent and eliminate the scourge of ragging of any type and the gravity of the issue, the Institution had constituted the formal Anti – ragging Cell comprising of the Anti-ragging Committee and the Anti –ragging Squad way back in 2009-10 in compliance with the UGC regulations on Curbing the menace of ragging in higher educational institutions, 2009 and the suggestive guidelines listed under Clauses 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3. The Committee  includes members (Senior Professors, Associate/ Asst. Professors) representing all the Faculties with the Principal as the Chairperson and Vice Principal as the Secretary. The committee meets often and when needed to discuss directives received from UGC / AICTE and put them into action.
                                            Committee and the Squad are reconstituted every two years. The anti- ragging squad ensures the implementation of the preventive measure and undertakes field visits to ensure ragging free campus.
